## ðŸš€ My blog

This is the repo for my personal blog, which can be found at https://garethveale.dev/. 

This is built using the Gatsby blog starter template, which can be found here https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog.

Feel free to clone/fork this repo if you like the style, since I made some enhancements to the original template.

These include (but may not be limited to):

- A custom landing page (in front of the blog post list)
- A seperate lits of book posts, as I wanted these independent from my blog posts
- Removal of some components, to create a more minimal 'feel' (bio at the bottom of each post)
- Introduced custom sorting for the post lists
- Light/dark theme toggle
