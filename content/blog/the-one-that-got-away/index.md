I read this book a long while back when I was roughly 15 or 16. In fact, it's one of only 2 books I read before the age of 21, at which point I developed an interest in reading. The reason I read it back then is the exact reason I chose to re-read it - I cannot put it down. 

I've always had an interest in military history, particularly WW2 and special forces. Coming from a military family, and with a dad that spent the better part of life serving, it was natural I would develop an interest. Couple that with a gripping tale of tremendous courage, persistence, and grit, and I'm left with a book that doesn't feel like reading. 

This is the true story of a member of a SAS patrol that gets compromised deep behind enemy lines in Iraq, during the first Gulf war. Chris Ryan and his squad initiate their E&E (escape and evasion) plan, making a run for the Syrian border. Inevitably, they're met with tons of challenges, and Ryan is the only one to successfully escape. This is an immense display of what the human body is capable of when the mind has the grit and determination to never give up. 

I read this with ease the first time, and I enjoyed it, even more, the second. However, I only rate it a 7 as not everyone will find this as interesting as me, and am therefore less likely to recommend it. If you have any interest in military history, do yourself a favor and pick this one up.
