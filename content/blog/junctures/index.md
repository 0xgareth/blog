You'll agree this year has been an odd one, COVID-19 has put a lot of things into perspective. It's hard to put into words exactly what they are, however I feel it's altered the trajectory of my life. Prior to the pandemic, I had a rough idea of what I wanted from my career/life/goals - but on refelection, not really. Through this extended period of isolation and working from home, I've spent a lot of time pondering what it is I want, and how I'd like to go about it. One thing is clear, I hope to get as much fulfillment on the way as possible.

I'm considering this point in my life to be one of those you look back on, and realise it was at that stage you could have taken a left, or a right. I recently moved in with one of my closest friends from school, we think the same, share the same interests, and have the same vision. Additionally, since starting on a grad scheme out of uni, I entertained the notion of moving into a trading/automated trading role, but have soon come to realise that won't satisfy my desire for independence. I'm excited at the prospect of what's ahead, but I can't lie I'm beginning to grow impatient. I'm 26, which i'm aware is young, but I have a long, long road ahead to get to where I want to be. I haven't figured everything out yet, but one thing is for sure - I want to build something of my own, and prepared to continue learning on the way.

I plan to start documenting this journey as it may prove to be useful for some/entertaining for others. I plan to be as transparent as possible, which may not serve me well in some cases, but c'est la vie...

Rest of 2020
- Consume as much startup/indie hackers knowledge as possible
- Launch a Youtube channel with Ben
- Continue broadening my CS knowledge (I plan to cover this in more depth in the future)
