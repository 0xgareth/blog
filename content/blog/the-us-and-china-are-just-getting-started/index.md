2020 has been a whirlwind already. I don't intend to be the one to deliver added lousy news, but I'd like to provide some updates on the current geopolitical and macroeconomic outlook. I preface this by saying I'm not an expert. I don't hold a degree in economics. I do, however, have an interest in understanding the global picture and feel, at times, it can be hard to translate into layman's terms.

In case you were living under a rock in 2019, the US and China had a pretty substantial fallout. Given they're the two largest economies, this proved to be a pretty big deal. Both sides fought to fire the economic gun at the other by placing enormous tariffs on import goods, causing the cost of imported Chinese goods in the US to rocket, and vice versa. I won't delve into the matches that lit the fire on this war, but it seemed each side had come to a somewhat fragile truce when the pandemic came around. That was until this happened. 

In late May, the US published a memorandum under the National Security Council. It's challenging to interpret this document as anything less than a de facto declaration of war. The first paragraph is sufficient enough to grant you a sense of the tone.

As Grant Williams points out in his Leung Telegram, before the cold war began, a member of the US embassy in China provided his opinion on Russia's refusal to endorse the World Bank. Stalin had spoken out at the time, stating capitalism and communism could not co-exist and that it was their job to ensure communism prevailed. 

It's essential to keep this in mind as we observe the developments between these two nations unfold. Rather curious timing, a few days after this memorandum was released, China announced it plans to impose a new security law on Hong Kong "without the slightest delay." It's difficult not to believe this was China's method of saying 'the gloves are off,' and they're holding back no more.

What's more, China has begun excusing immense quantities of emerging market economies debt. A classic geopolitical play to court favour among smaller economies as a means to take leadership in the face of political conflict. 

I'm no economist, but it's not difficult to recognize that we could be on the precipice of some pretty rough circumstances. I plan to begin sharing some additional observations in the coming weeks, so stay tuned.
