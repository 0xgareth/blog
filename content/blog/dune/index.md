I read the first part of this sci-fi series in 2020, during the first lockdown in the UK. It's one of few books that I couldn't put down. This series is at the cross-section of science, philosophy, technology, politics, and war. There's tons of themes, ranging from geology to conciousness, through to psychology and epistomology.

I'm almost finished with the second part - Dune Messiah - and am delighted it's as good as the first. 

Though I haven't read Game of Thrones, I get the impression a lot of the themes are drawn from these novels (the first part was written in 1965). 

The language can be quite challenging at times, which I appreciate, and am glad I'm reading the second part on my kindle (the dictionary feature is 👌 ).

I'm not even going to say if you enjoy sci-fi read this, if you enjoy reading, read this.

There's a movie being released this year, with a huge cast (and Hans Zimmer scored), based on the first half of the first book, giving you another reason to read it. 

Some of my favourite quotes from the second book are below, even these demonstrate how well written these books are - strong 10/10.

> "Belief can be manipulated. Only knowledge is dangerous.”

> “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear …”

> "No matter how exotic human civilization becomes, no matter the developments of life and society nor the complexity of the machine/human interface, there always come interludes of lonely power when the course of humankind, the very future of humankind, depends upon the relatively simple actions of single individuals."

> “There’s but a thin line between many an enemy and many a friend,”
