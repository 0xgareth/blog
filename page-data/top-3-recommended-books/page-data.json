I made this selection based on the level of impact these books had on my life. Firstly, by shaping how I think. Secondly, by teaching me lessons I feel are invaluable, that I find myself continuously referring back to. Below are my brief thoughts on what I believe you can expect from each. </p>\n<h3>Meditations, Marcus Aurelius (Gregory Hays translation)</h3>\n<p>This book is a collection of thoughts or journal entries of a Roman emperor by the name of Marcus Aurelius. He was not only one of the most powerful men in history, but also an avid Stoic. These entries, though likely not intended for mass consumption, offer some incredible wisdom, and substantial teachings from the school of Stoicism. </p>\n<p>Being a large fan of Stoicism, this book immediately piqued my interest. Though FWIW, if you haven’t heard of this school of Philosophy it’s not important. The passages here, in my humble opinion, will help everyone live a more balanced, fulfilling life. </p>\n<p>Even if you simply read this for the knowledge that you’re reading the journal entries of a Roman Emporer, it’s pretty neat. I recommend the Gregory Hay’s translation, it seems agreed to be the easiest to interpret. </p>\n<h3>Man’s Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl</h3>\n<p>Next on the list is a book written by a Holocaust and Auswitchz survivor. Being a psychiatrist, he records an interesting account of his time within the concentration camps. He explores the mental psyche of those around him, how it affected them, and shares his observations of what he believes to be the reason some survived, and others gave up. As you would expect this is not an easy read, though in my opinion books that aren’t, often offer the best lessons. </p>\n<p>Read this if you want to feel more appreciation for the simple things in life, and for an education on how to handle adversity, difficulties, and challenges. </p>\n<h3>Not Fade Away, Lawrence Shames and Peter Barton</h3>\n<p>Finally, is a book I’ve read a few times over. This one is less intense as the others, though that’s not to say the lessons within are any less important. This book explores the life of the very successful founder of Liberty Media (an extremely powerful and influential media company). After being diagnosed with terminal cancer, he spends time reflecting on his life with an author (Lawrence Shames), discussing his achievements, experiences, and the lessons he learnt throughout. </p>\n<p>This is a candid take on the road to success, and ultimately the trade-offs that may be experienced as a result. Peter opens up about the challenges he faced raising children while building and managing a business empire. It’s an important account of what can happen if time isn’t spent considering life satisfaction over fortune and fame. Pick this up for humor and wisdom, but be prepared to become pretty emotionally invested. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"3 Books Everyone Should Read","date":"September 22, 2020","description":"3 books I believe everyone should read and digest.","minread":3}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/top-3-recommended-books/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/builder-your-own-gatsby-blog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Build and deploy your personal blog using GatsbyJS and GH Pages","tags":["programming"],"type":"blog"}},"next":null}}}
