I don’t intend to be the one to deliver added lousy news, but I’d like to provide some updates on the current geopolitical and macroeconomic outlook. I preface this by saying I’m not an expert. I don’t hold a degree in economics. I do, however, have an interest in understanding the global picture and feel, at times, it can be hard to translate into layman’s terms.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In case you were living under a rock in 2019, the US and China had a pretty substantial fallout. Given they’re the two largest economies, this proved to be a pretty big deal. Both sides fought to fire the economic gun at the other by placing enormous tariffs on import goods, causing the cost of imported Chinese goods in the US to rocket, and vice versa. I won’t delve into the matches that lit the fire on this war, but it seemed each side had come to a somewhat fragile truce when the pandemic came around. That was until this happened. </p>\n<p>In late May, the US published a memorandum under the National Security Council. It’s challenging to interpret this document as anything less than a de facto declaration of war. The first paragraph is sufficient enough to grant you a sense of the tone. Read more <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/U.S.-Strategic-Approach-to-The-Peoples-Republic-of-China-Report-5.20.20.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since the United States and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) established diplomatic\nrelations in 1979, United States policy toward the PRC was largely premised on a hope that\ndeepening engagement would spur fundamental economic and political opening in the PRC\nand lead to its emergence as a constructive and responsible global stakeholder, with a more\nopen society. More than 40 years later, it has become evident that this approach\nunderestimated the will of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to constrain the scope of\neconomic and political reform in China.\nThe CCP has chosen instead to exploit the free and open rulesbased order and attempt to reshape the international system in its favor. - <strong>United States Strategic Approach to the People’s Republic of China, May 2020</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Grant Williams points out in his Leung Telegram, before the cold war began, a member of the US embassy in China provided his opinion on Russia’s refusal to endorse the World Bank. Stalin had spoken out at the time, stating capitalism and communism could not co-exist and that it was their job to ensure communism prevailed. </p>\n<p>It’s essential to keep this in mind as we observe the developments between these two nations unfold. Rather curious timing, a few days after this memorandum was released, China announced it plans to impose a new security law on Hong Kong “without the slightest delay.” It’s difficult not to believe this was China’s method of saying ‘the gloves are off,’ and they’re holding back no more.</p>\n<p>What’s more, China has begun excusing immense quantities of emerging market economies debt. A classic geopolitical play to court favour among smaller economies as a means to take leadership in the face of political conflict. </p>\n<p>I’m no economist, but it’s not difficult to recognize that we could be on the precipice of some pretty rough circumstances. I plan to begin sharing some additional observations in the coming weeks, so stay tuned. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The US and China are just getting started","date":"June 18, 2020","description":"The trade war might be dwarfed by this...","minread":3}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/the-us-and-china-are-just-getting-started/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/roam-research-intro/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Roam Research: Reogranise your life and learning with a second brain","tags":["productivity"],"type":"blog"}},"next":null}}}
