It’s one of few books that I couldn’t put down. This series is at the cross-section of science, philosophy, technology, politics, and war. There’s tons of themes, ranging from geology to conciousness, through to psychology and epistomology.</p>\n<p>I’m almost finished with the second part - Dune Messiah - and am delighted it’s as good as the first. </p>\n<p>Though I haven’t read Game of Thrones, I get the impression a lot of the themes are drawn from these novels (the first part was written in 1965). </p>\n<p>The language can be quite challenging at times, which I appreciate, and am glad I’m reading the second part on my kindle (the dictionary feature is 👌 ).</p>\n<p>I’m not even going to say if you enjoy sci-fi read this, if you enjoy reading, read this.</p>\n<p>There’s a movie being released this year, with a huge cast (and Hans Zimmer scored), based on the first half of the first book, giving you another reason to read it. </p>\n<p>Some of my favourite quotes from the second book are below, even these demonstrate how well written these books are - strong 10/10.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Belief can be manipulated. Only knowledge is dangerous.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear …”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“No matter how exotic human civilization becomes, no matter the developments of life and society nor the complexity of the machine/human interface, there always come interludes of lonely power when the course of humankind, the very future of humankind, depends upon the relatively simple actions of single individuals.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“There’s but a thin line between many an enemy and many a friend,”</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dune, Frank Herbert","date":"January 23, 2021","description":"My notes on Dune by Frank Herbert","minread":2,"rating":10,"genre":["fiction"],"published":"August 01, 1965"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/dune/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-one-that-got-away/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The One That Got Away, Chris Ryan","genre":["military-history"],"type":"book"}},"next":null}}}
